If you have problem with react-navigation with me, next of initial your ReactNative.js project you will install following package from npmjs site:

don't forget write --save for saving modules in your dependencies!

# necessary:

npm i @react-native-community/masked-view 

npm i react-navigation

npm i react-navigation-stack

# should be install your prog:

npm i react-native-gesture-handler "not really use"

npm i react-native-reanimated 

npm i react-native-safe-area-context
